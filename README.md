# ResNet_on_Cats_vs_Dogs


The steps that will be done in order to complete the experiment

The main goal of the notebook is to do transfer learning using resnet.

We will get the resnet18 model

We will then run the first model on a cats and dogs pictures. Find all the relevant classification metrics.

Then we will take the vanilla resnet and unfreeze some of the last few layers. 
We will then perform some training using the cats and dogs pictures.
We will then test and perform validation on cats and dogs pictures.



We will first begin by downloading and cats and dogs dataset from kaggle.

We will also get the resnet-18 from huggingface

I then have to read the documentation on how to use the model to make predictions

I also need to read the documentation on how to unfreeze some layers in order to perform some transfer learning
